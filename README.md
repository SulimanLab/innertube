Python Client for Google's Innertube API (works with YouTube, YouTube Music etc.)

## Introduction
This project began as a client for the YouTube Music Web Api.
However it turns out that YouTube *and* YouTube Music share the same innertube api.

This allows one single codebase to interact with *both* YouTube and YouTube Music!

There are at least 6 clients for the innertube api:
